        <p>The Directorate of Open and Distance Learning(DODL), Dibrugarh University was established in 2001 with a
            vision
            to reach the unreached. During the last three decades, it was observed that most of the Department and the
            Centres of studies of the University received a large number of applications for admission into different
            programmes offered. Due to limited number of seats in post-graduate and under-graduate classes, a large
            number
            of students fail to enroll themselves as students of the University. Considering the necessity of enabling
            the
            youths who are either employed or self-employed and who are unable to prosecute higher education due to
            economic
            or other reasons, the University has set the vision of taking Higher Education to the doorsteps of the
            learners.

        </p>

        The major objectives of the Directorate are :

        <ol>
            <li>To provide access to quality higher education to the people of the region who are deprived of higher
                education due to various reasons.</li>
            <li>To provide higher education to those who wish to upgrade or acquire knowledge through studies in various
